/**
 * The Landlord plugin is an add-on to the Lands plugin that provides additional quality of life functionality for
 * monitoring player activity and land ownership limitations. This is done for the purpose of having limits and
 * requirements that players must ensure are adhered to / met. <br><br>
 *
 * If not met, the Plugin allows for enforcement of said requirements and limitations via actions such as automatic
 * land ownership transferal and land deletion.<br><br>
 *
 * This is supplemented by the ability for players, with the appropriate permissions, to execute manual searches,
 * allowing for more confident server administration. <br><br>
 *
 * The Landlord plugin was originally developed by CuriosityCore Development.
 * @version 1.0
